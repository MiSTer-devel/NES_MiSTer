 - A Revision of BMF's bmfpal40.pal [http://bmf.rustedmagick.com/]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Great thanks goes to the people whose work has been of inestimable value to this
project, e.g. making this project possible in the first place. They are:
  * BMF, for the source palette - bmfpal40.pal
  * Gavin, for "Palette Compare", a viewer made for comparing NES palettes
    [http://gavin.panicus.org/projects.php]
  * Members of the NES emulation community in general, for the many great
    advancements they have made available for others to enjoy.
  * Nintendo, for giving the world a reason to play -- revitalizing the video
    game industry with such a fun little box.

This release finalized  July 22, 2006  2:00 PM (EST)  --  RealityC.PAL

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Insanity Is Its Own Reward.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As before, a formula-based approach was used in the creation of this palette,
but its complexity proved too agonizing for me to fully enumerate.  Just know
that I did ensure general consistency during the palette's formation.

This is not a perfectly accurate palette; I no longer have literal accuracy as
the primary goal.  My intent has been to create a palette of colors that look
good when used together, resemble the "best" versions of colors that I have seen
the NES produce on traditional TVs, and represent the colors that I believe they
were originally intended to be.  Finding an appropriate balance of these factors
has proven so difficult that once I had it, any further changes seemed to only
dissolve this fragile equilibrium.

I have enjoyed using this very palette for a few months now, and I see no
purpose in delaying its release any further.  This could easily be my last foray
into the field of NES palette re-creation, unless I encounter an unexpectedly
strong reason to reconsider and reconstruct another public release.

Hopefully my palette will help enhance the NES experience just a bit, for those
who choose to use it.  Thank you, and good night.

Post Script Extras:
 - My favorite freeware Hex Editor: [http://www.catch22.net/software/]

As I doubt many people have guessed, naming my recent palettes "RealityB.pal",
etc. is not really meant to declare supremacy.  I like to think of them as
"alternate realities" -- RealityA, RealityB, RealityC...  You get to be in
control; you choose your *own* reality.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Story Behind the Palette
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

May 06, 2005  3:04 PM  --  ASQUIRE.PAL (Original Release)

I don't know about you, but I have never been fully satisfied with any color
palette that has been available for NES emulators to use (.pal format).

The best that I found was custom work done by BMF. Since he got the colors
directly from snapshots of the television screen (with special tools/software),
it was closer to the real thing than anyone else's palettes, which most likely
used hand-picked colors without a real basis for them. Still, I was disappointed
that none of BMF's palettes seemed completely accurate.

However, through extensive comparisons (in several of my favorite games), I
determined that the 4.0 version of his palette was the best of all his revisions
(near perfect, actually), but it was simply too dark. He also had a
"brightness-corrected" edition of v4.0, but it was too pale, and some colors
were less accurate.

After searching for a palette editor, I found Palette Compare
[http://gavin.panicus.org/projects.php], a simple Windows program by Gavin that
displays every color in a .pal file, along with the corresponding Hexadecimal
value. It can even show two palettes at once, for easy comparison.

Using this as an invaluable reference, I was able to reliably hex-edit
"bmfpal40.pal" to increase the brightness of colors—to a lesser extent than
BMF's variation. I also made sure to do it *properly*, without disrupting the
original color values.

The "Choice" NES palette has arrived.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Story Continues...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

May 09, 2005  2:25 PM  --  ASQUIRE2.PAL

This new revision has exactly seven colors that are changed, including three
shades of blue-green (two taken from "BMFFINR2.PAL", the other from
"BMFPAL50.PAL"), two shades of maroon/burgundy (from "BMFPAL50.PAL"), the bluest
bright blue (also from "BMFPAL50.PAL"), and the impure "black" (just darkened a
bit).

All of the colors were brightness-adjusted to match the relative levels of the
colors that were replaced. The black was just semi-arbitrarily darkened to what
looks like a "good" level because I have no established basis for where it
should actually be, unlike the other colors.

Anyway, this should be more enjoyable than the first one I made; I estimate a
40% increase in enjoyment (on average) when playing a game that utilizes these
newly improved colors. Have fun!


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Revisiting the Past...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

May 18, 2005  10:36 PM  --  ASQUIRE3.PAL

It turned out that my brightness corrections for the new colors were not as
complete as they were supposed to be. The lighter maroon-pink and the darker two
of the three new blue-greens hadn't been properly adjusted; this time they have.

The same two blue-greens have also been altered a bit for a different balance of
blue and green; they are now slightly more green, and they are the first and
only colors to be modified in any way other than brightness. I believe that it
now looks more like it should.

Amidst these changes and fixes, I realized that I had no good reason to replace
the "bluest bright blue" (with the corresponding color in "BMFPAL50.PAL") in my
last revision, so I have swapped it back to the value used in my palette's first
release.


May 19, 2005  1:16 PM  --  ASQUIRE3.PAL

Hmm. I noticed another change that I should have made for this release. The
bright pink color, which is related to the maroon-pinks, has been exchanged for
the "BMFPAL50.PAL" value. That is all, and there is only a slight difference, so
I decided to just re-release this under the same revision number.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Back to the Basics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

May 22, 2005  4:40 PM  --  ASQUIRE4.PAL

Hearkening back to my original concept of only using colors from BMF's palettes,
this version replaces the two darker blue-greens yet again. It now utilizes the
brightness-adjusted colors from "BMFFINR3.PAL", and it looks even better than
before (but the difference is minimal). This _should_ be the last change for
those two colors. Hopefully I won't find something else that needs improvement.
:P


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mistaken No More
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

May 31, 2005  6:17 PM  --  ASQUIRE5.PAL

I had forgotten about one swap I made for my initial palette release; I inserted
a dark grey in place of one of the (identical) quasi-blacks because
"BMFPAL50.PAL" had it that way. It looked good in the palette viewer, but maybe
I should have realized that it probably wouldn't be right since it was the only
one of BMF's palettes (except for "BMFPAL51.PAL", which was a direct revision of
the other) to have that as a dark grey instead of 'black'.

The odd appearance of "Maniac Mansion" has convinced me to revert the dark grey
to match the other quasi-blacks.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Reinventing the System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

June 06, 2005  2:20 PM  --  ASQUIRE6.PAL

Here lies the proud results of some extensive experimentation with the rules to
which I hold myself accountable in the making of this palette.

First of all, staying true to the use of colors taken only from BMF's palettes,
I have included the purple-ish blues from "BMFFINR1.PAL" (2 changed colors), the
lightest blue-green from "bmfpal22.pal", the bright orange from "bmfpal11.pal",
and the purples, red-purples, and yellows from "BMFPAL50.PAL" (12 colors); that
is sixteen "new" colors in total, all of which were brightness-adjusted
appropriately.

The other big change, affecting three-fourths of the palette, is sweeping
alteration to the brightness of colors. There are four "tiers" of color
brightness/intensity in the NES palette, meaning four shades of red, four of
purple, four of blue-green, etc. The relative brightness levels of each tier to
the others have been modified to reduce the gaps between them. The resulting
effect is significantly closer to the appearance it would have on a TV.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lousy Bug-fixing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

June 08, 2005  11:44 PM  --  ASQUIRE6.PAL

Well, I found a 'bug' in the palette that needed to be corrected. The
medium-dark yellow/brown was not aligned relative to the other new yellows; this
was an issue in BMF's own 5.0 palette which he fixed for "BMFPAL51.PAL" (the
other yellows remained the same). My palette now has that improvement as well.

Same version number because it is too high already, and this was meant to be
part of the last release anyway.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Happy Ending
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

June 23, 2005  1:29 PM  --  Reality.PAL

More than a simple upgrade, this palette returns to the root of its existence,
"bmfpal40.pal". After much toiling, I discovered the method by which the source
palette could be adjusted towards true accuracy.

Because listing the colors that have changed since the last release would be
pointless, given that I started from scratch, I will instead elaborate on the
formula I utilized for the entire palette in order to achieve the desired end
result.


For those colors that have, of the three core "color-ingredients" (red, green,
and blue):
-Only one of the three: add 16 (or, converted into hexadecimal form, "10")
-Two of the three: add 8 to the 'lesser' core-color and 24 (hex: "18") to the
 'greater' core-color
-All three: add 8 to the 'lesser' core-color, 16 to the 'neutral' core-color,
 and 24 to the 'greater' core-color

To have consistency in determining what the 'greater', 'lesser', and 'neutral'
core-colors are for each color in the palette, I simply divided the palette into
two equal parts, two 'sets' that would be treated separately but identically for
individual colors within each group. The whites, blacks, and greys were a group
unto themselves; I added 16 (hex: "10") to each core-color within them (the
"true" black was left untouched).

As labeled below, Color Set #1's 'greater' core-color is blue, 'lesser' is red,
and 'neutral' is green. Color Set #2's 'greater' core-color is red, 'lesser' is
blue, and 'neutral' is green. The following is a list of numerical designations
given to colors by Palette Compare (in hexadecimal values, of course),
distinguishing to which color set each belongs.
Color Set #1:  01-04,0B-0C,11-14,1B-1C,21-24,2B-2C,31-34,3B-3C
Color Set #2:  05-0A,15-1A,25-2A,35-3A


While it may still not be perfect, I'm confident that this is closer to the real
thing than anyone has previously achieved. Behold and enjoy.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It Never Ends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

July 11, 2005  2:28 PM  --  RealityA.PAL

Ok, -this- time I've finally figured out how to make the sky blue in Super Mario
Bros. (while still maintaining some consistency in my overall procedure). Not
only that, but everything else is looking better too! My notes below demonstrate
what I did—starting with the original "bmfpal40.pal"—to create this release.

For Three Core Ingredients:
Color Set #1 +42 blue, +18 green
Color Set #2 +42 red, +18 green

For Two Core Ingredients:
Color Set #1 +31 blue, +9 green
Color Set #2 +31 red, +9 green

For One Core Ingredient / For Greys:
+20 of that color / +20 each color

I also changed the quasi-black; it is now +12 (each color) instead of +16.

Now, the biggest breakthrough I've made in formulating my method: the sky is
blue, the grass is green, etc. For those colors of the palette that reach a
maximum in intensity (i.e. hex: "FF") for one of the "color ingredients" before
all has been added to it, I simply took the leftover adding of that core-color
and subtracted half of the amount from the other two core-colors to effectively
increase the relative value of the over-dosed core-color.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Not Just Another Palette . . .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

November 09, 2005  3:02 PM  --  RealityB.PAL

First, I'd like to give BMF an extra special thanks for creating, and offering
publicly, the perfect basis (bmfpal40.pal) for me to use in this palette
project. I could not have come this far without his work preceding mine.

This is a fairly idealized version of the NES's true palette; I based it mainly
on my more vivid memories of playing the NES in its glory days. Since I was
judging colors by their relative appearance (next to other colors) and
extensively comparing them in several games, I am confident in the results I
have obtained.

Essentially, I added (in hexadecimal) 20 per "color-ingredient" to the entire
palette and altered the distribution of the total of 60 or 40 (per color) among
the "color-ingredients" to achieve more accurate colors. By comparison, Red and
Blue were added equivalently throughout, while Green had much less added to the
palette overall.

~~Procedural Nonsense:
The formulaic changes to the colors are listed by column, which are denoted by
the numerical assignment given by Palette Compare to the first color in each
respective column. There are two sets of color additives for each distinct
column. The first applies to colors of the source palette (bmfpal40.pal) which
have a non-zero amount of each of the "color-ingredients" (red, green, and
blue); the second set of added "color-ingredients" applies to the remaining
colors in the column (those with fewer than three "color-ingredients").
Quasi-blacks and greys have equal amounts added each of red, green, and blue.
All numbers/amounts below are given in hexadecimal form.

Quasi-Blacks: RGB+10
Greys: RGB+20
01: R+1A G+14 B+32
   < G+08 B+38
02: R+1C G+12 B+32
   < B+20
03: R+20 G+10 B+30
   < R+14 B+2C
04: R+2A G+0C B+2A
   < R+20 B+20
05: R+30 G+10 B+20
   < R+2C B+14
06: R+32 G+12 B+1C
   < R+20
07: R+32 G+14 B+1A
   < R+38 G+08
08: R+34 G+16 B+16
   < R+36 G+0A
09: R+32 G+14 B+1A
   < R+34 G+0C
0A: R+26 G+14 B+26
   < G+20
0B: R+1A G+14 B+32
   < G+0C B+34
0C: R+16 G+16 B+34
   < G+0A B+36
